Picture of the gopuram of one of the great temples the Pandyas built. You can't help but wonder how they must have built these structures in the 13th century. Seen here is the Sathiyavageeswarar temple in Kalakad. Dedicated to Lord Shiva. This is from my visit to my birth place in 2011..My father's big family used to live there. This was my last visit to the place. Memories..
