## Alapuzha, Kerala

🥥 🌴 🏖️ At the end of the day, this is what you live for. Backwaters of Kerala. I took this picture on a train journey from Alapuzha to Trivandrum. Taken using my iPhone 7. Its not for nothing  that Kerala is called Gods own country. If you want to see a place of lush green, this is the place to go. Surrounded by coconut trees, rivers and lakes, its the perfect vacation spot. Close to nature as it gets.
