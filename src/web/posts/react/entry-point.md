# 8.1 Create an entry point

## Summary
In the previous 2 chapters, we saw how to setup your development environment, how to initiate the project, configure your editor for work etc. We also pushed the code into our repo. In this chapter, we will write our first line of the actual source code.

Create a file called `src/web/index.js`. This file is called as the entry point. We need an entry point because a few simple reasons. But first, you need to understand how we are going to build this app.

The end product of this application will be just one `.js` file, say, `app.bundle.js`. We will reference this file in a html document called `index.html`. When a user visits the website, he will see the html file which in turn calls `app.bundle.js.` And its in this js file that all the logic of the app lies. But, we will not be writing our code in the `app.bundle.js` file. We will have a proper source code with directories, helper files etc. and we will use a bundler like Webpack to bundle the entire source code to one single file.

## How Webpack works
We will tell Webpack to use `src/web/index.js` as the main entry point. When webpack starts bundling, it creates a dependency tree starting from here, going inside each module and into its submodules and the submodules inside the submodules, so on and so forth extending the dependency tree, and eventually dumps all of the source code into 1 file called as the `app.bundle.js`.

We need to bundle the source code for other reasons too. For example, It gives us the ability to use latest features of Javascript to write the code. But, though not all browser vendors might not have implemented the latest features (or people could just be using older versions of browsers), we can (or have to) transform or compile down the source code to formats which most browsers understand. We do this by telling Webpack to use babel as the compiler to compile the code.

So, we will use ES6/ES7 to write code and compile it down to ES5.

## Install

`npm i --save react react-dom`

## Configure

Create a file in this path: `src/web/index.js` with the following code:

## Code

    import React, { Component } from 'react';
    import { render } from 'react-dom';

    class App extends Component {
      render() {
        return <h1>Hello, World</h1>;
      }
    }

    render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

Commit and push.

Though we have created the entry point, we cannot see it in action yet because we need to implement the compilation and bundling processes.
