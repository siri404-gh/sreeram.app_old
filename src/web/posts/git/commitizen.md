# Commit linting using Commitlint

## Summary

According to me, commit messages are the history of your application.  Commitlint is a commit message linter which helps you in creating uniform commit messages. For eg, fixing commit messages will now be "fix: fixes that thing".

## Install

`npm install -g commitizen`

Next, initialize your project to use the cz-conventional-changelog adapter by typing:

`commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --save-dev --save-exact`

## Configure

Add the below config code to your package.json. This sets `cz-conventionl-changelog` as the adaptor.

    config": {
      "commitizen": {
        "path": "cz-conventional-changelog"
      }
    }

Add this to npm script

    "scripts": {
      "commit": "git-cz"
    }

Now, instead of commiting with `git commit`, you can use `npm run commit` to commit your changes. But, still it doesnt enforce everyone using the repository to follow suite. For that, we will use commitlint and husky.
