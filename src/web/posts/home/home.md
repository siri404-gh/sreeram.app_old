# Web Boilerplate Project

#### Sep 1, 2018 by Sreeram Padmanabhan

Hey, I am Sreeram Padmanabhan, or simply Sree. I am a Web developer and this is a boilerplate project using the lastest web technologies you can use to create your own website with zero or minimal configuration. Also, this is a tutorial of how I created it.  If you have felt that Web development has become very complex these days with all the frameworks, tooling, the config, the lanugages, the number of different browsers, testing, etc and want to understand the core tenets of each, you have come to the right place. Navigate through the links in the left sidebar to learn about each topics.

## What you will learn

You will learn all about creating your development environment, writing your first line of code, to deploying a full fledged website to production. 

## Who I am

The story unfolds when I created my first blog somewhere in 2005. My firends at school had this forum for my class and it created a buzz. They also were making money using Google Adsense. Me, although being new to computers, always wanted to do something like that. But you didnt have to know anything technical to use Blogger. I also enrolled in Adsense but never really got paid. But, it wasnt until 2007/8 when I took part in an online treasure hunt (something like a quiz where you couldnt just search google to find the answer to the question) and I did so amazingly well that I wanted to build it for my own college. Thats how I took the baby steps into the ocean of Web Development. I started with HTML, creating webpages with Dreamweaver and softwares like that, encrypted it using a software with a password, and deployed it somewhere. I dont remember what happened after that but it did not end well. So I decided to do it properly and decided get in touch with the guys who created the online treasure hunt. Unfortunately, they did not help me much but said I could achieve it with PHP. I had absolutely no idea what that was back then. So I set out to learn php. I learnt some basic HTML, CSS and Javascript and ended up creating the online treasure hunt. I took the help of my school friends to deploy it. And voila, it was received well by all. A few of my friends played it. And then the next big idea struck me. I decided to conduct it in my college. This time, i took time and put a real good effort and came up with an amazing frontend with HTML and CSS (I still hated javascript), and PHP as backend. Around 500 people registered and played the game of 40 levels and somebody won. Not sure if I rewarded them, but it was a huge success. All the while not knowing his would eventually become my career. 

This knowledge of creating websites until 2011, got me my first job at a start up, Mistallianz where I worked for 6 months. Then I got a job at Wipro. Although I started initally as a C developer in Wipro, I found my own opportunity in web development in a different location. From there, I have grown and grown. I have worked with people from Apple, Bitovi before moving to London in 2016 to work for Lloyds Bank and I have been there ever since.

Over the years, I have gathered a good amount of knowlegdge of the web. I constantly face issues and I constantly think about solving them. I have also started and failed in creating my own start up of a Job site. I have grown from the boy who used Dreamweaver to create webpages to a good programmer. I have big ideas but its hard to find time to do it. About a month ago, I wanted to do a technical blog and its been good so far. All the best.
