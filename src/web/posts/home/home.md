Hey, I am Sreeram Padmanabhan. Some friends call me Sree. I am a Web Developer and this is my Web Boilerplate project. Its a comprehensive tutorial on how to create your own website from scratch. This website will be performant, will look pleasing, will be responsive, accessible and will be search engine optimised. It will use the latest web technologies which most enterprise companies use today.

At the end of this tutorial, you will have a boilerplate project from which you can build any application you want and deploy to the Web, Mobile or even as a Desktop app with zero or minimal configuration. Infact, this very website was made using the boilerplate. Navigate through the links in the left sidebar to learn more about each topic.

## What you need to know

You need to the basics of Web Development like HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git, Unix etc. Also, follow the chapters in the left in the given order for best results.

## What you will learn

You will start with some cool concepts of HTML CSS and Javascript. You will then learn all about creating your own Development environment, writing your first line of code, following good practices, writing unit tests, automation tests, deployment to staging/production and monitoring.

## End to end flow

All you will do is write code and push it to Github. CI-CD does the rest. Travis just builds it. I felt that its slower than Circle CI. CIrcle CI is where most of the heavy lifting is done for this boilerplate. So once code is pushed to Github, Circle CI takes it, runs the following in under 5 minutes.

- Lint check using Eslint.
- Unit test using Karma, Jasmine and Chromeheadless.
- Accessibility test using Pa11y.
- Code Coverage reporting to Codecov, Sonar, Codacy, Code Climate.
- Integration Tests using Browserstack.
- Build for Production
- Generate Styleguide
- Deploy to a Staging server
- Performance tests using Lighthouse
- Deploy to Production if all of the above pass.
- Deploy to Heroku/Firebase/Bluemix

## A bit about me

My story unfolds in 2005 when my friends at school had this forum for my class which created a buzz. It was used for all the class gossips. They also were making money using Google Adsense. Me, although being new to computers, always wanted to do something like that. Thats when I found Blogger. I didnt have to know anything technical to use Blogger. I also enrolled in Adsense but never really got paid because my blog wasnt very popular.

It wasnt until 2007/8 when I took part in an online treasure hunt (something like a quiz where you couldnt just search google to find the answer) and I did so amazingly well that I wanted to build it for my own college. Thats how I took the baby steps into the ocean of Web Development. I started with HTML, creating webpages with Dreamweaver and softwares like that, encrypting them using a software with the answer as the password, and deployed it somewhere. I dont remember what happened after that but it did not succeed. So I decided to do it properly and decided get in touch with the guys who created the online treasure hunt. Unfortunately, they did not help me much but said I could achieve it with PHP. I had absolutely no idea what that was back then. So I set out to learn PHP. I learnt some basic HTML, CSS, and PHP and ended up creating the online treasure hunt for my college. I took the help of my school friends to deploy it. And voila, it was received well by all. Around 500 people registered and played the game of 40 levels and somebody won. Not sure if I rewarded them, but it was a huge success. All the while not knowing his would eventually become my career. Then, I started to conduct this game independently on my own. They were all reasonably good successes.

I used to attend Web Development contests throughout my final 2 years of college which I'd mostly win. Good old days when I used to memorize tags and syntax. My friends always wanted to be my partner because they were assured of half of the prize money. Lol. They took turns to be my partner. Thats when I knew I had found my call. In 2010, I was asked to create the website for an IEEE conference.

I have also started and failed in creating my own start up. Actually I ended it abrupty because it wouldnt have succeeded and because I had to move to a different city for Job.

All this knowledge of creating websites until 2011, landed me my first job at a start up where I worked for 6 months as a PHP Developer. Then I got a job in a Multi National Company. Although I started initally as a C developer there, I found my own opportunity in Web Development in a different location in the same company. From there, I havent looked back. I have worked with developers from Apple, Bitovi and moved to London in 2016 to work for Lloyds Bank and I have been working there ever since. The work here has been challenging every day and I am proud to have been a good problem solver here.

I know it is only a matter of time before I get my next big break.

So, over the years, I have gathered a good amount of knowlegdge of the Web. I constantly face issues and I constantly think about solving them. I have grown from the boy who used Dreamweaver to create Webpages to a good programmer. I have other big ideas but its becoming increasingly hard to find the time to do it. About a month ago, I wanted to do a technical blog and all this is a result of that.
