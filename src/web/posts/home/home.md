Hey, I am Sreeram Padmanabhan. Some friends call me Sree. I am a Web Developer and this is my photography website. I live in London involved in one of most creative businesses ever.

## The story of my life

My story unfolds in 2005 when my friends at school had this forum for my class which created a buzz. It was used for all the class gossips. They also were making money using Google Adsense. Me, although being new to computers, always wanted to do something like that. Thats when I found Blogger. I didnt have to know anything technical to use Blogger. I also enrolled in Adsense but never really got paid because my blog wasnt very popular.

It wasnt until 2007/8 when I took part in an online treasure hunt (something like a quiz where you couldnt just search google to find the answer) and I did so amazingly well that I wanted to build it for my own college. Thats how I took the baby steps into the ocean of Web Development. I started with HTML, creating webpages with Dreamweaver and softwares like that, encrypting them using a software with the answer as the password, and deployed it somewhere. I dont remember what happened after that but it did not succeed. So I decided to do it properly and decided get in touch with the guys who created the online treasure hunt. Unfortunately, they did not help me much but said I could achieve it with PHP. I had absolutely no idea what that was back then. So I set out to learn PHP. I learnt some basic HTML, CSS, and PHP and ended up creating the online treasure hunt for my college. I took the help of my school friends to deploy it. And voila, it was received well by all. Around 500 people registered and played the game of 40 levels and somebody won. Not sure if I rewarded them, but it was a huge success. All the while not knowing his would eventually become my career. Then, I started to conduct this game independently on my own. They were all reasonably good successes.

I used to attend Web Development contests throughout my final 2 years of college which I'd mostly win. Good old days when I used to memorize tags and syntax. My friends always wanted to be my partner because they were assured of half of the prize money. Lol. They took turns to be my partner. Thats when I knew I had found my call. In 2010, I was asked to create the website for an IEEE conference.

I have also started and failed in creating my own start up. Actually I ended it abrupty because it wouldnt have succeeded and because I had to move to a different city for Job.

All this knowledge of creating websites until 2011, landed me my first job at a start up where I worked for 6 months as a PHP Developer. Then I got a job in a Multi National Company. Although I started initally as a C developer there, I found my own opportunity in Web Development in a different location in the same company. From there, I havent looked back. I have worked with developers from Apple, Bitovi and moved to London in 2016 to work for Lloyds Bank and I have been working there ever since. The work here has been challenging every day and I am proud to have been a good problem solver here.

I know it is only a matter of time before I get my next big break.

So, over the years, I have gathered a good amount of knowlegdge of the Web. I constantly face issues and I constantly think about solving them. I have grown from the boy who used Dreamweaver to create Webpages to a good programmer. I have other big ideas but its becoming increasingly hard to find the time to do it. About a month ago, I wanted to do a technical blog and all this is a result of that.

I am also an active in instagram. I try to post regularly at [instagram.sreeram.app](http://instagram.sreeram.app)
