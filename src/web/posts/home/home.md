# Web Boilerplate Project

#### Sep 1, 2018 by Sreeram Padmanabhan

Hey, I am Sreeram Padmanabhan, or simply Sree. I am a Web developer and this is my Web Boilerplate project. This deals with how to create your own website from scratch. If you have ever felt that Web development has become very complex these days with all the frameworks, tooling, the config, the languages, the number of different browsers, testing, etc and want to understand the core tenets of each, you have come to the right place. This project is about creating a flexible frontend boilerplate website using the lastest web technologies. From that boilerplate, you can extend it to create your own website with zero or minimal configuration. Infact, this very website is made using the boilerplate.

Navigate through the links in the left sidebar to learn about each topics. What I assume is that you'd follow the topics in order from top to bottom. Also, I assume that you know the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## What you will learn

You will learn all about creating your own development environment, writing your first line of code, writing tests etc to deploying it to production, all automatically. 

## End to end flow in brief
All I do is write code and push it to github. Travis CI and Circle CI do the rest. Travis just builds it. I felt that its slower than Circle CI where most of the heavy lifting is done. So once code is pushed to github, Circle CI takes it, runs lint checking, unit tests, integration tests, accessibility tests, code coverage reporting, deploys to a staging server, performs a lighthouse performance test and once everything passes, it deploys to production.

## Who I am

My story unfolds in 2005 when I created my first personal blog. My friends at school had this forum for my class and it created a buzz. They also were making money using Google Adsense. Me, although being new to computers, always wanted to do something like that. I didnt have to know anything technical to use Blogger. I also enrolled in Adsense but never really got paid because my blog wasnt very popular. It wasnt until 2007/8 when I took part in an online treasure hunt (something like a quiz where you couldnt just search google to find the answer to the question) and I did so amazingly well that I wanted to build it for my own college. Thats how I took the baby steps into the ocean of Web Development. I started with HTML, creating webpages with Dreamweaver and softwares like that, encrypted it using a software with a password, and deployed it somewhere. I dont remember what happened after that but it did not succeed. So I decided to do it properly and decided get in touch with the guys who created the online treasure hunt. Unfortunately, they did not help me much but said I could achieve it with PHP. I had absolutely no idea what that was back then. So I set out to learn php. I learnt some basic HTML, CSS and Javascript and ended up creating the online treasure hunt for my college. I took the help of my school friends to deploy it. And voila, it was received well by all. Around 500 people registered and played the game of 40 levels and somebody won. Not sure if I rewarded them, but it was a huge success. All the while not knowing his would eventually become my career. Then, I started to conduct this game on my own. They were all reasonably good successes. I was also asked to create the website for an IEEE conference in 2008.

This knowledge of creating websites until 2011, got me my first job at a start up where I worked for 6 months. Then I got a job at a multi national company. Although I started initally as a C developer there, I found my own opportunity in web development in a different location. From there, I havent looked back. I have worked with people from Apple, Bitovi before moving to London in 2016 to work for Lloyds Bank and I have been working there ever since. I know it is only a matter of time I get my next big break.

So, over the years, I have gathered a good amount of knowlegdge of the web. I constantly face issues and I constantly think about solving them. I have also started and failed in creating my own start up. I have grown from the boy who used Dreamweaver to create webpages to a good programmer. I have other big ideas but its hard to find time to do it. About a month ago, I wanted to do a technical blog and its been good so far.
