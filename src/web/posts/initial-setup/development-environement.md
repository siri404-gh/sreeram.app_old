## About this chapter

In this chapter, we will set our development environment up. 

I personally tend to use state of the art softwares and hardwares for my development work. For Web development which involves frontend, backend, devops, testing work, I prefer the below software specs. Using these will save a lot of time in the long run and without these, its easy to get frustrated. Like for eg, the speed of your code build depends on your build process and machine specs. A faster machine and an efficient build process ensure a faster feedback and encourages a fail fast, fail often mechanism. As someone great said, *Good code comes from a good habitat.*

## OS

**macOS High Sierra** *10.13.6* - I prefer a Linux based machine rather than Windows. SImply because web development involves a lot of unix commands and linux based machines offer just that. Mac OS according to me, provides the best performance. Although I would love to have an iMac so that I can see all windows at once, because I always tend to have VS Code, Youtube in Chrome and the local build of the app at all times, instead of having to constantly switch between workspaces and tabs, I havent bought it yet.
