# Softwares

#### Sep 1, 2018 by Sreeram Padmanabhan

I tend to use start of the art softwares and hardwares to my development work. For web development which involves frontend, backend, devops, testing work, I prefer the below software specs.
This will save a lot of time in the long run. Like for eg, the speed of your code build depends on your machine specs. 

## OS

`macOS High Sierra` *10.13.6*

I prefer a Linux based machine rather than windows. SImply because web development involves a lot of unix commands and linux based machines offer just that. Mac OS according to me, provides the best performance. Although I would love to have an iMac so that I can see all at once, instead of having to constantly switch between workspaces and tabs, I havent bought it yet.
