# VS Code Extensions

#### Sep 1, 2018 by Sreeram

Over the past few years of using Visual Studio Code, it has grown so much to my liking thanks to the ease of use and the flexibility it offers. There is something new to learn all the time and its smooth as silk. Also, the community of users is growing and it has a large extension base which makes using this a pleasurable experience over Atom or Sublime text. They are updated constantly and the rating system enables you to choose the best one for you. One problem I often face is that these extensions are constantly updated and you need to restart the application for the update to take effect. Add that to the VS Code updates and it can be a bit annoying to have it restart a few times every day.

In this post, I shall put down here my favourite extensions which have helped me in creating this project.

## EditorConfig for VS Code

This plugin attempts to override user/workspace settings with settings found in .editorconfig files. For more, go to https://editorconfig.org/

## VS Code ESLint extension

Integrates ESLint into VS Code. If you are new to ESLint check their documentation at https://eslint.org/.

## Path Intellisense

Visual Studio Code plugin that autocompletes filenames.

## Npm Intellisense

Visual Studio Code plugin that autocompletes npm modules in import statements.

## Relative path

Now you can get the relative path to any file in the workspace.
